This project has significance in renewable energy research, as accurately predicting power output can help in optimizing the design and operation of wave energy converters, leading to more efficient and sustainable energy production.

## ***Goal Of this Project : ***

The primary goal of this project is to analyze and compare power consumption patterns between Perth and Sydney across two datasets with varying regional granularity: Perth_49 vs. Sydney_49 and Perth_100 vs. Sydney_100. Using machine learning regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression), the project aims to:

# **1.Predict Power Consumption:**

Create predictive models to accurately estimate power usage based on features provided in the dataset.
Identify Key Factors: Use feature importance analysis to understand which factors (e.g., temperature, time of day) most influence power consumption in each region.

# **2.Detect Patterns and Differences:**:

 Examine if there are significant differences in power usage patterns between Perth and Sydney and assess whether these vary with the dataset's regional granularity (49 vs. 100 regions).

# **3.Evaluate Model Performance and Overfitting:**

Test models on both training and testing sets to ensure generalizability and prevent overfitting, allowing the model to perform well on unseen data.

# **4.Provide Insights for Energy Management:**

Derive insights that could potentially help energy providers or policymakers in planning and optimizing power distribution in Perth and Sydney.


# ***Data Story : ***
Comparing Power Consumption in Perth and Sydney**
Introduction:
In this data story, we are analyzing power consumption data from two Australian cities: Perth and Sydney. The datasets, labeled Perth_49, Sydney_49, Perth_100, and Sydney_100, represent energy consumption measurements from these cities over time. Each dataset contains information on power usage across different time intervals or features. Our goal is to extract insights into power consumption patterns, detect anomalies or outliers, and highlight key features that contribute to variations in energy usage.

Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to:

Compare power consumption between Perth and Sydney.
Detect outliers in the data using the Z-score method.
Visualize patterns in power usage using time-series and distribution plots.
Identify key features contributing to power consumption through feature importance analysis.
